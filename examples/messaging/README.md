# Messaging UI Demo

This is an example of a Stripe dashboard app that displays recent messages from a customer on the customer page. It can be extended to display messages from any source with an API, including email and chat services.

API code needs to be added that fetches message data from a 3rd party source. See [the documentation](https://stripe.dev/tailor-preview/super-secret-private-ui-docs/?path=/docs/getting-started-ui-extensions--page#calling-a-3rd-party-api) for more.
