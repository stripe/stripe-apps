# Secret Store UI Extension Demo

This is an example of using the Secret Store API from a UI extension. The extension allows you to fetch, set, and delete secrets associated with the currently authenticated user.

In a real application, the secret value would most likely be consumed from an OAuth callback or from an API request that fetches secret material.

See the [Secret Store docs](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects) to learn more about the API, and the [API reference](https://stripe.com/docs/api/secret_management) for request and response definitions.
