# [Demo] Authenticate with Github using OAuth

An example application that uses a custom back end server to authenticate the user with Github using OAuth.

Before you run this application, ensure you are set up by following the [UI Extension docs](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-apps).

This example uses [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) with [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) to start the front end application and the back end server concurrently.

Before starting the app, you will need to:

- Create a `.env` file inside the `/backend` folder with your Github Client Id and Client Secret variables. The included `.env.example` file can be used as a template.
- Run `yarn generateKeys` inside the `/backend` folder to generate a certificate for running the local back end server over HTTPS. (_Note_: these local keys won't be trusted by your browser. For example, in Chrome, when the requests are inevitably blocked, type `thisisunsafe` while the tab is open to proceed.)
- View your [Stripe API keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) to get values for `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`. To get a value for the `.env` variable `STRIPE_APP_SECRET`, you will need to upload your app to Stripe. You can do this with `yarn workspace frontend upload`. Then go to the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apps) to find your app and the generated key.
- [Create a new OAuth app within your Github account](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app). For this development server's current configuration, you should set **Homepage URL** to `http://localhost:8080` and **Authorization callback URL** to `https://localhost:8080/auth/callback/logged-in`. Use the values you get during this process to fill in `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.

To run the application, run the following commands from the root folder:

```zsh
# install and hoist dependencies
yarn
```

```zsh
# start the front end and back end app concurrently
yarn start
```

The back end server will start on `localhost:8080`.

To start either the front end or the back end individually, you can use the following commands respectively:

```zsh
yarn run start:frontend
yarn run start:backend
```
