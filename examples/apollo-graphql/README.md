# Apollo GraphQL demo

An example Stripe App that uses Apollo to connect to a GraphQL API and fetch data from it.

To run this application, ensure you are setup by following the [UI Extension docs](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-apps)

Once you have the `stripe-preview` CLI fork available, run the start command from the application directory:

```
stripe-preview apps start
```
_Make sure you install with `yarn` before serving!_
