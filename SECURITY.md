# Security Policy

### Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open GitHub issues or pull requests for security vulnerabilities - this makes the problem immediately visible to everyone, including malicious actors.   

Security issues in this open-source project can be safely reported to Stripe's [Vulnerability Disclosure and Reward Program](https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe#disclosure-and-reward-program).
Stripe's security team will triage your report and respond according to its impact on Stripe users and systems.
