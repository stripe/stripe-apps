## Friction Logs

We encourage you to share feedback through a format that we call for Friction logs. Friction logs are documents that describe the frustrations and delights of a product, focused around a specific use case. They're also intended to be brutally honest - feel free to vent or to praise!

You can use this template by the [Tensorflow team](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/sigs/build/tensorflow-testing.md) to have a structure: [TensorFlow friction log template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HVG3t-mgGZKU4iMeguTWGejbnQ54qUTXwdCFkA5xHG0/edit)
