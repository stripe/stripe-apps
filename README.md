General questions should be asked in the [Stripe Discord](https://stripe.com/go/developer-chat) `#pvt-stripe-apps` channel. To gain access to the private channel, follow these steps:

1. Join the [Stripe Discord](https://stripe.com/go/developer-chat).
2. Request access to the private channel by letting your Stripe contact know your full Discord handle, including the 4 digit suffix. E.g. `name#1234`.

**Note: The Discord private channel is shared amongst all members of the private beta. Treat it as you would any public space on the Internet.**

## Friction Logs

We encourage you to share feedback through a format that we call for Friction logs. Friction logs are documents that describe the frustrations and delights of a product, focused around a specific use case. They're also intended to be brutally honest - feel free to vent or to praise!

You can use this template by the [Tensorflow team](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/sigs/build/tensorflow-testing.md) to have a structure: [TensorFlow friction log template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HVG3t-mgGZKU4iMeguTWGejbnQ54qUTXwdCFkA5xHG0/edit)
