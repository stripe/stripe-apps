Stripe App Platform
-------------------

Welcome to the new, improved Stripe App Platform! Stripe Apps allow developers to customize and extend how Stripe works in order to support each business's unique needs.

## Capabilities

### UI extensions
UI Extensions allow apps to extend the Stripe Dashboard with their own custom UI.

[Learn more about building your own UI extension.](./ui-extensions/readme.md)

### App backend
Stripe apps can call their own backends as well as register webhooks to receive events from accounts that have the app installed.

### [Coming soon!] Custom objects
Custom objects will allow developers to store their own data inside of Stripe. They can enforce constraints on it and associate it with Stripe objects.

### [Coming soon!] Secret store
The Stripe Secret Store will allow developers to securely store cryptographic material in order to authenticate and communicate with external services.
