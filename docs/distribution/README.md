## App Distribution

As an app developer, you have two options to distribute your app. You can choose to distribute your app as a `private app` where only your organization have access to the team, or you can choose to publish your app as `public app` to the Stripe App Marketplace, where you can reach millions of entrepreneurs around the world.
